We\'ve also been involved in a variety of local initiatives to educate families about how to stay safe while surfing the web. Here are a few highlights: 
In the U.S., we\'ve worked with Common Sense Media to promote awareness about online safety and have donated hardware and software to improve the ability of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to combat child exploitation. 
Google UK has collaborated with child safety organizations such as Beatbullying and Childnet to raise awareness about cyberbullying and share prevention messages, and with law enforcement authorities, including the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, to fight online exploitation. 
Google India initiated "Be NetSmart," an Internet safety campaign created in cooperation with local law enforcement authorities that aims to educate students, parents, and teachers across the country about the great value the Internet can bring to their lives, while also teaching best practices for safe surfing. 
Google France launched child safety education initiatives including Tour de France des Colleges and Cherche Net that are designed to teach kids how to use the Internet responsibly. 
And Google Germany worked with the national government, industry representatives, and a number of local organizations recently to launch a search engine for children. 
As part of these ongoing efforts to provide online safety resources for parents and kids, we\'ve created Tips for Online Safety, a site designed to help families find quick links to safety tools like SafeSearch, as well as new resources, like a video offering online safety pointers that we\'ve developed in partnership with Common Sense Media. In the video, Anne Zehren, president of Common Sense, offers easy-to-implement tips, like how to set privacy and sharing controls on social networking sites and the importance of having reasonable rules for Internet use at home with appropriate levels of supervision. 

Users can also download our new Online Family Safety Guide (PDF), which includes useful Internet Safety pointers for parents, or check out a quick tutorial on SafeSearch created by one of our partner organizations, GetNetWise. 

We all have roles to play in keeping kids safe online. Parents need to be involved with their kids\' online lives and teach them how to make smart decisions. And Internet companies like Google need to continue to empower parents and kids with tools and resources that help put them in control of their online experiences and make web surfing safer.',

    'text' => 'The new rules mean that the most valuable marketing event is almost always an inbound phone call. 

An inbound phone call is the ultimate in short-term permission. The customer or prospect is taking the time to call you. She\'s focused, interested, paying attention and willing to trust you. 

Think for a minute about how much you spend (and how high up in the organization the discussions go) when it\'s time for a new logo or a new Super Bowl ad. 

And yet, even though the rules have changed, the lowest-paid, least-respected, highest-turnover jobs in the organization now do the most important marketing work. 

Scharffen-Berger Chocolate (which I\'ve featured in some of my books) was bought by Hershey three years ago. They bought it because of me (and people like me). People who will go out of their way to find high quality dark chocolate and then pay a huge premium to buy it. 

I\'ve been really disappointed with the quality of their product for a few months. It seems to me that in order to ramp up production, they\'ve smoothed out some edges and the product is becoming boring. Fewer high notes,  less interesting. So, I called. 

The operator, who couldn\'t have been nicer, offered me a coupon for a free replacement bar. 

A replacement of what? More of the same mediocre product I was calling to complain about? 

Of course, she was just doing her job, but who\'s fault is that? Who decided to give her nothing but a script, who decided not to take the inbound calls seriously,  who decided that it made sense to put up a wall instead of opening a door? I guess the short version is, "why isn\'t the brand manager answering the phone?" 

"Your call is very important to us," 

does not jibe with, 

"Due to unusually heavy call volume." 

And the phrase, "I\'m sorry, I\'m just doing my job," does not match up with the marketing event of a person taking the time to call (or to email). 

No, of course Sumner Redstone can\'t answer every single letter sent to Viacom. But... 

Shouldn\'t every single inbound call be answered in one ring? Shouldn\'t there be as much spent on self-service customer support as is spent on the design of the selling part of your website? Shouldn\'t you be tracking in the finest detail what people have to say when they call in? Shouldn\'t you be rewarding call center operators by how long they keep people on the phone, not how many calls they can handle a minute? Shouldn\'t there be an easy, fast and happy way for an operator to instantly upgrade a call to management (not a supervisor, I hate supervisors) who can actually learn something from the caller, not just make them go away? 

And I guess that\'s my biggest point: the goal of every single interaction should be to upgrade the brand\'s value in the eye of the caller and to learn something about how to do better, not to get the caller to just go away.',

    'text' => 'A quick glimpse at just about any profession shows you that the vast majority of people who succeed professionally also went to college. 

This could be because college teaches you a lot. 

Or it could be because the kind of person that puts the effort into getting into and completing college is also the kind of person who succeeds at other things. 

Firefox is similar. 

Example: 25% of the visitors we track at Squidoo use Firefox, which is not surprising. But 50% of the people who actually build pages on the site are Firefox users. Twice as many. 

This is true of bloggers, of Twitter users, of Flickr users... everywhere you look, if someone is using Firefox, they\'re way more likely to be using other power tools online. The reasoning: In order to use Firefox, you need to be confident enough to download and use a browser that wasn\'t the default when you first turned on your computer. 

That\'s an empowering thing to do. It isolates you as a different kind of web user. 

If I ran Firefox, I\'d be hard at work promoting extensions and power tools (I love the search add-ons) and all manner of online interactions. Think of all the things colleges do to amplify the original choice of their students and to increase their impact as alumni. 

And if I ran your site, I\'d treat Firefox visitors as a totally different group of people than everyone else. They\'re a self-selected group of clickers and sneezers and power users. 

In the lingo of Nancy Reagan, Firefox is a gateway drug.',

Think about that one for a bit. 

So much effort is going to be spent building this business. Money and time invested in design and promotion and, possibly, hypnosis. Why? To trick people. 

I\'m amazed every single day at the lengths some people will go to in order to run scams online. It\'s so much more work to create a spam site or a deceptive come on, so much more work to deal with the angry customers and be hiding from them... 

I can imagine it becomes a habit. Once you start cutting corners and playing a selfish game to see how far you can bend (or break) the rules, it must be hard to stop. It\'s all relative, and what they\'re doing must seem relatively benign compared to someone else. Of course, there\'s always someone more crooked, always someone more selfish...
