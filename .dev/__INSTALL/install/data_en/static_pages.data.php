<h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.</p>

<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</p>

<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

<p>For the developers\' and authors\' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\' and
authors\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</p>

<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>',

<h2>Unofficial Translations</h2>

<h3><a id="UnofficialTranslations"></a>Information about unofficial
translations</h3>

<p>
The reason the FSF does not approve these translations as officially
valid is that checking them would be difficult and expensive (needing
the help of bilingual lawyers in other countries).  Even worse, if an
error did slip through, the results could be disastrous for the whole
free software community.  As long as the translations are unofficial,
they can\'t do any harm, and we hope they help more people understand
the GPL.</p>
<p>
We give permission to publish translations of the GPL, GFDL, or LGPL
into other languages, provided that you (1) label your
translations as unofficial (see below for how to do this), to
inform people that they do not count legally as substitutes for
the authentic version, and (2) you agree to install changes at our
request, if we learn from other friends of GNU that changes are
necessary to make the translation clearer.</p>
<p>
To label your translations as unofficial we want you to add the
following text at the beginning,
both in English and in the language of the translation&mdash;replacing
<em>language</em> with the name of that language:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General Public License
into <tt>language</tt>.  It was not published by the Free Software
Foundation, and does not legally state the distribution terms for
software that uses the GNU GPL&mdash;only the original English text of the
GNU GPL does that.  However, we hope that this translation will help
<tt>language</tt> speakers understand the GNU GPL better.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If you make a translation, please inform the GNU Translation Managers
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">&lt;web-translators@gnu.org&gt;</a>.
They will check to make sure that your translation follows the above
guidelines and make a link to it from this page.</p>

<p>
To make easily process of searching translation, please, use language code in brackets.

<p>
In the beginning of years, when the world was so new and
all, and the Animals were just beginning to work for Man, there
was a Camel, and he lived in the middle of a Howling Desert
because he did not want to work; and besides, he was a Howler
himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed
and prickles, most \'scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to
him he said \'Humph!\' Just \'Humph!\' and no more.
</p>
<p>
Presently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle
on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said, \'Camel, O Camel,
come out and trot like the rest of us.\'
</p>
<p>
\'Humph!\' said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the
Man.
</p>
<p>
Presently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and
said, \'Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of
us.\'
</p>
<p>
\'Humph!\' said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.
</p>
<p>
Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said,
\'Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.\'
</p>
<p>
\'Humph!\' said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and
the Ox together, and said, \'Three, O Three, I\'m very sorry for
you (with the world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the
Desert can\'t work, or he would have been here by now, so I am
going to leave him alone, and you must work double-time to make
up for it.\'
</p>
<p>
That made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all),
and they held a palaver, and an _indaba_, and a _punchayet_, and a
pow-wow on the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on
milkweed _most_ \'scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he
said \'Humph!\' and went away again.
</p>
<p>
Presently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts,
rolling in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because
it is Magic), and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the
Three.
</p>
<p>
\'Djinn of All Deserts,\' said the Horse, \'is it right for any one
to be idle, with the world so new-and-all?\'
</p>
<p>
\'Certainly not,\' said the Djinn.
</p>
<p>
\'Well,\' said the Horse, \'there\'s a thing in the middle of your
Howling Desert (and he\'s a Howler himself) with a long neck and
long legs, and he hasn\'t done a stroke of work since Monday 
morning. He won\'t trot.\'
</p>
<p>
\'Whew!\' said the Djinn, whistling, \'that\'s my Camel, for all the
gold in Arabia! What does he say about it?\'
</p>
<p>
\'He says "Humph!"\' said the Dog; \'and he won\'t fetch and carry.\'
</p>
<p>
\'Does he say anything else?\'
</p>
<p>
\'Only "Humph!"; and he won\'t plough,\' said the Ox.
</p>
<p>
\'Very good,\' said the Djinn. \'I\'ll humph him if you will kindly
wait a minute.\'
</p>
<p>
The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing
across the desert, and found the Camel most \'scruciatingly idle,
looking at his own reflection in a pool of water.
</p>
<p>
\'My long and bubbling friend,\' said the Djinn, \'what\'s this I
hear of your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?\'
</p>
<p>
\'Humph!\' said the Camel.
</p>
<p>
The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think
a Great Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection in
the pool of water.
</p>
<p>
\'You\'ve given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all
on account of your \'scruciating idleness,\' said the Djinn; and he
went on thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.
</p>
<p>
\'Humph!\' said the Camel.
</p>
<p>
\'I shouldn\'t say that again if I were you,\' said the Djinn; you
might say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.\'
</p>
<p>
And the Camel said \'Humph!\' again; but no sooner had he said it
than he saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and
puffing up into a great big lolloping humph.
</p>
<p>
\'Do you see that?\' said the Djinn. \'That\'s your very own humph
that you\'ve brought upon your very own self by not working. 
To-day is Thursday, and you\'ve done no work since Monday, when
the work began. Now you are going to work.\'
</p>
<p>
\'How can I,\' said the Camel, \'with this humph on my back?\'
</p>
<p>
\'That\'s made a-purpose,\' said the Djinn, \'all because you missed
those three days. You will be able to work now for three days
without eating, because you can live on your humph; and don\'t you
ever say I never did anything for you. Come out of the Desert
and go to the Three, and behave. Humph yourself!\'
</p>
<p>
And the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to
join the Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears
a humph (we call it \'hump\' now, not to hurt his feelings); but he
has never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the
beginning of the world, and he has never yet learned how to
behave.
</p>
<p>

THE Camel\'s hump is an ugly lump
  Which well you may see at the Zoo;
But uglier yet is the hump we get
  From having too little to do.
</p>
<p>
Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,
If we haven\'t enough to do-oo-oo,
    We get the hump--
    Cameelious hump--
The hump that is black and blue!
</p>
<p>
We climb out of bed with a frouzly head
  And a snarly-yarly voice.
We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
  At our bath and our boots and our toys;
</p>
<p>
And there ought to be a corner for me
(And I know there is one for you)
    When we get the hump--
    Cameelious hump--
The hump that is black and blue!
</p>
<p>
The cure for this ill is not to sit still,
  Or frowst with a book by the fire;
But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
  And dig till you gently perspire;
</p>
<p>
And then you will find that the sun and the wind.
And the Djinn of the Garden too,
    Have lifted the hump--
    The horrible hump--
The hump that is black and blue!
</p>
<p>
I get it as well as you-oo-oo--
If I haven\'t enough to do-oo-oo--
    We all get hump--
    Cameelious hump--
Kiddies and grown-ups too!</p>',

IN the sea, once upon a time, O my Best Beloved, there was a
Whale, and he ate fishes. He ate the starfish and the garfish,
and the crab and the dab, and the plaice and the dace, and the
skate and his mate, and the mackereel and the pickereel, and the
really truly twirly-whirly eel. All the fishes he could find in
all the sea he ate with his mouth--so! Till at last there was
only one small fish left in all the sea, and he was a small
\'Stute Fish, and he swam a little behind the Whale\'s right ear,
so as to be out of harm\'s way. Then the Whale stood up on his
tail and said, \'I\'m hungry.\' And the small \'Stute Fish said in a
small \'stute voice, \'Noble and generous Cetacean, have you ever
tasted Man?\'
</p>
<p>
\'No,\' said the Whale. \'What is it like?\'
</p>
<p>
\'Nice,\' said the small \'Stute Fish. \'Nice but nubbly.\'
</p>
<p>
\'Then fetch me some,\' said the Whale, and he made the sea froth
up with his tail.
</p>
<p>
\'One at a time is enough,\' said the \'Stute Fish. \'If you swim to
latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West (that is magic), you
will find, sitting _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the sea, with
nothing on but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders
(you must _not_ forget the suspenders, Best Beloved), and a jack-
knife, one ship-wrecked Mariner, who, it is only fair to tell you,
is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.\'
</p>
<p>
So the Whale swam and swam to latitude Fifty North, longitude
Forty West, as fast as he could swim, and _on_ a raft, _in_ the
middle of the sea, _with_ nothing to wear except a pair of blue
canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you must particularly
remember the suspenders, Best Beloved), _and_ a jack-knife, he
found one single, solitary shipwrecked Mariner, trailing his
toes in the water. (He had his mummy\'s leave to paddle, or else
he would never have done it, because he was a man of infinite-
resource-and-sagacity.)
</p>
<p>
Then the Whale opened his mouth back and back and back till it
nearly touched his tail, and he swallowed the shipwrecked
Mariner, and the raft he was sitting on, and his blue canvas
breeches, and the suspenders (which you _must_ not forget), _and_
the jack-knife--He swallowed them all down into his warm, dark,
inside cup-boards, and then he smacked his lips--so, and turned
round three times on his tail.
</p>
<p>
But as soon as the Mariner, who was a man of infinite-resource-
and-sagacity, found himself truly inside the Whale\'s warm, dark,
inside cup-boards, he stumped and he jumped and he thumped and
he bumped, and he pranced and he danced, and he banged and he
clanged, and he hit and he bit, and he leaped and he creeped, and
he prowled and he howled, and he hopped and he dropped, and he
cried and he sighed, and he crawled and he bawled, and he stepped
and he lepped, and he danced hornpipes where he shouldn\'t, and
the Whale felt most unhappy indeed. (_Have_ you forgotten the
suspenders?)
</p>
<p>
So he said to the \'Stute Fish, \'This man is very nubbly, and
besides he is making me hiccough. What shall I do?\'
</p>
<p>
\'Tell him to come out,\' said the \'Stute Fish.
</p>
<p>
So the Whale called down his own throat to the shipwrecked
Mariner, \'Come out and behave yourself. I\'ve got the hiccoughs.\'
</p>
<p>
\'Nay, nay!\' said the Mariner. \'Not so, but far otherwise. Take
me to my natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and I\'ll
think about it.\' And he began to dance more than ever.
</p>
<p>
\'You had better take him home,\' said the \'Stute Fish to the
Whale. \'I ought to have warned you that he is a man of
infinite-resource-and-sagacity.\'
</p>
<p>
So the Whale swam and swam and swam, with both flippers and his
tail, as hard as he could for the hiccoughs; and at last he saw
the Mariner\'s natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and
he rushed half-way up the beach, and opened his mouth wide and
wide and wide, and said, \'Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot,
Nashua, Keene, and stations on the _Fitch_burg Road;\' and just as
he said \'Fitch\' the Mariner walked out of his mouth. But while
the Whale had been swimming, the Mariner, who was indeed a person
of infinite-resource-and-sagacity, had taken his jack-knife and
cut up the raft into a little square grating all running criss-
cross, and he had tied it firm with his suspenders (_now_, you
know why you were not to forget the suspenders!), and he dragged
that grating good and tight into the Whale\'s throat, and there
it stuck! Then he recited the following _Sloka_, which, as you
have not heard it, I will now proceed to relate--
</p>
<p>
  By means of a grating
  I have stopped your ating.
</p>
<p>
For the Mariner he was also an Hi-ber-ni-an. And he stepped out
on the shingle, and went home to his mother, who had given him
leave to trail his toes in the water; and he married and lived
happily ever afterward. So did the Whale. But from that day on,
the grating in his throat, which he could neither cough up nor
swallow down, prevented him eating anything except very, very
small fish; and that is the reason why whales nowadays never eat
men or boys or little girls.
</p>
<p>
The small \'Stute Fish went and hid himself in the mud under the
Door-sills of the Equator. He was afraid that the Whale might be
angry with him.
</p>
<p>
The Sailor took the jack-knife home. He was wearing the blue
canvas breeches when he walked out on the shingle. The suspenders
were left behind, you see, to tie the grating with; and that is
the end of _that_ tale.
